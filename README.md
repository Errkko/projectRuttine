# Project Ruttine
This is a personal project I'm working on in tandem with my studies towards being an embedded & IOT developer. This project is aimed towards making a program in C (maybe changed to C++ depending on how this developes) that tracks and reminds you of everything you need to do each day. Basically a really bad calendar that only shows 1 day at a time.
Further down the road i want this to be running on a standalone hardware with a screen attached, to act as sort of a digital calendar. How will i do this? I have no idea. This project will be a tool for me to learn new things, so don't expect anything fancy.

## Why?
I have just been diagnosed with a terminal illness. Not life-threatening, but one that forces me to make extreme changes in my day-to-day life. One that requires me to keep track of things i have to do every day or week.
Before this I didn't have to take any medicine or keep any real checklist of what i had to do each day. This mixed with the fact that I've hated every calendar-app I've ever tried, drove me to start this project. 

## What the program will do
A lot of things. Maybe too many. I will probably add/remove a lot of things during this project, but below you will find the current functions i aim to make.

**Main functions**
+    1: Show a daily checklist of recurring tasks, daily/weekly/bi-weekly/monthly.
+    2: Give the option to add/remove/edit these tasks.
+    3: Set priority of each task. Medicine and doctors appointments takes top priority. Important personal dates and work goes second. The rest is TBD.
+    4: Show todays weather, and maybe recommendation of what to wear?

**Secondary functions**
+    Show general information about inside climate (Temp in celsius, moisture, more stuff probably). Will require hardware with the appropriate sensors.

## This project will serve many purposes
+    To further my knowledge in programming and embedded/IOT developement
+    As a distraction/disconnect from my everyday life
+    To have fun and work on something that will be of help to me

## This is a work in progress!!
